# Working Together on the AI Potential Portal

## How This Works

You (Gareth) are working with two AI assistants:

1. **Me (in this Project)** - Strategic oversight, planning, reviewing progress, course correction
2. **Claude Code** - Hands-on implementation, writing code, building features

## The Workflow

1. Give Claude Code a phase brief (01-phase-a-courses.md, etc.)
2. Claude Code builds that phase
3. Test it yourself
4. Come back here to check in - share what's working, what's not
5. I'll help troubleshoot, adjust the plan, or prepare for the next phase
6. Repeat

## What to Bring Back Here

When checking in after a phase, tell me:

- **What's working** - Features that are done and tested
- **What's broken** - Bugs, issues, things that didn't work as expected
- **What's unclear** - Questions that came up during implementation
- **What changed** - Any deviations from the plan (that's fine, just note them)

## What I'll Help With

- Reviewing whether we're on track
- Adjusting the plan based on what you've learned
- Troubleshooting architectural issues
- Preparing the next phase brief if needed
- Making decisions on trade-offs
